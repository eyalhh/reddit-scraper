** Initial Setup **
I tried to use my fedora machine with an avd emulator , http toolkit for the sniffer and adb for the connection between the two but http toolkit doesnt work well with avds on linux.
I decided to switch to a windows operating machine, installed MEmu and httptoolkit and things ran better than before.
